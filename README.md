# 👋 Hi, this is Chenyang Zhou

I’m a Master student at **Columbia University, New York**, doing research in compiler and computer architecture. Before this, I did my undergrad in **Computer Science** from **UCSD**.

I mostly work on simulation and modeling for hardware resources and hardware accelerators.

If any of this sounds remotely interesting — or if you just want to chat about computer architecture, compiler, life, or pandas — shoot me an email: **[zhouchenyang2011@gmail.com](mailto:zhouchenyang2011@gmail.com)**

## 🐼 Pandas. Yes, Really.

When I'm not thinking about models, I’m thinking about pandas. The panda in my profile picture is **[He Hua (和花)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Hua_(giant_panda))**, a genuinely adorable creature who reminds me that not everything in life has to be optimized.

If you also believe pandas are peak existence (or just wanna discuss generative AI), you know where to find me.

## 🖼️ AI-Generated Me (Apparently)

When I ask ChatGPT to paint me, this is how it does. To be fair... I kind of like it.
